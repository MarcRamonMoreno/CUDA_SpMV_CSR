# CUDA_SpMV_CSR
    Introduction to Sparse Matrices:
    A sparse matrix is one in which most of the elements are zero.
    Storing all elements of such a matrix would be inefficient both in terms of memory and computational resources.
    In scientific computing and various engineering applications, matrices tend to be large and sparse.

    Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) Representation:
    The CSR format is a compact way to store sparse matrices. Instead of holding all n^2 elements, CSR only stores non-zero elements and their indices. There are three components to this format:
        An array that contains all non-zero values in the matrix.
        An array of column indices corresponding to each non-zero value.
        An array of row pointers indicating where each row starts in the array of non-zero values.

    SpMV Algorithm:
    The Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication algorithm multiplies a sparse matrix with a dense vector.
    The operation y = Ax multiplies matrix A with vector x to yield vector y.
    In a parallel SpMV algorithm, this multiplication is done in a way that exploits the sparsity pattern by skipping calculations involving zero entries of A.

    CUDA Parallelization:
    CUDA allows this operation to be parallelized over thousands of threads on a GPU, with each thread handling a portion of the computation.
    The parallelization strategy often involves assigning rows or sets of rows of A to different threads, thereby dividing the work efficiently.

    Steps in the CUDA-based SpMV Algorithm:
    a. Input Matrix Size and Values: The user inputs the size n and then provides the values of the n x n matrix A along with their positions.
    b. Conversion to CSR: The input matrix is converted to CSR format on the CPU. This pre-processing step is important for efficient parallel computation on the GPU.
    c. Transfer to GPU Memory: The CSR arrays and vector x are transferred to GPU memory, which is optimized for the high-throughput requirements of the multiplication.
    d. Kernel Execution: A CUDA kernel is launched where each thread or block of threads computes one or more outputs of the result vector y based on the division of work.
    Threads read from the CSR data and the vector x, multiplying and summing as needed.
    e. Result Retrieval: After computation, the result vector y is transferred back to the CPU memory.
    f. Output Display: Finally, the results are displayed, showing the product of the sparse matrix-vector multiplication.

By following this process, SpMV can be performed efficiently on large matrices using the powerful parallel processing capabilities of GPUs.
This explanation includes the conceptual understanding as well as the computational flow of the algorithm when implemented with CUDA.
